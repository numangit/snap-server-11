        "description": "Another branch of commercial photography is product photography, where you are typically shooting in a studio with careful lighting to accentuate the product in question (though sometimes outdoors or on location). In the same way as commercial portraiture, a product photographerâ€™s goal is to match the vision of the company in question. An outdoor brand will have different needs from a high-end lifestyle company, even if both sell the same underlying type of product, such as clothing or backpacks.",
